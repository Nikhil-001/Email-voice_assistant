# Voice Assistant for emails
The voice assistant helps in checking the unread emails by reading them out, and also can be used to send mails simply by giving voice commands. The Gmail API provided by Google is used for this project along with python. More information about Gmail API can be found here- [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest).
